      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever seen a traveling website that is not trying to sell to you? I doubt it, every other website does not care too much of the quality of your vacation and picnics, they do care more about sponsoring the places that they can have a revenue from. This is exactly what I do and what you have been waiting for, I create sites that are minimalistic and focus on giving a true and reliable review of hikes, trails, and parks to the consumer with no interest on money but solely on the travelers experience.

There is several studies made that determine that the human brain is getting more and more overloaded with information as years advance, there is so much information in the web and so many advertisements that it is hard for the human brain to focus in everything that is why the brain chooses one or to things to get out of when visiting a website.
